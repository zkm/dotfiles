# Git Project Manager

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felipecaputo/git-project-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felipecaputo/git-project-manager)

Git Project Manager (GPM) is a Microsoft VSCode extension that allows you to open a **new window targeting a git repository** directly from VSCode window.

## Available commands

Currently there are 3 avaliable commands, all of them can be accessed via **Ctrl+Shift+P**
*(Cmd+Alt+P on Mac)* typing **GPM**

### GPM: Open Git Project *(Defaults to: Ctrl+Alt+P)*
Show a list of the available git repositories in all folders configured in **gitProjectManager.baseProjectsFolders**.
The first time it searchs all folders, after that it uses a cached repository info.

### GPM: Refresh Projects
This commands refresh the cached repositories info for all configured folders.

### GPM: Refresh specific project folder
This commands allows you to select a specific folder to refresh its repositories, without
refreshing all folders.

### GPM: Open Recent Git Project *(Defaults to Ctrl+Shift+Q)*
This command will bring a list of your most recent git projects, leting you swap even faster between them.

The size of the list if configured in `gitProjectManager.recentProjectsListSize`

## Available settings

Before start using GPM you need to configure the base folders that the extension will
search for git repositories. Edit settings.json from the **File -> Preferences -> Settings** and add the
following config

    {
        "gitProjectManager.baseProjectsFolders": [
            "/home/user/nodeProjects",
            "/home/user/personal/pocs"
        ]
    }

Another available configuration is **gitProjectManager.storeRepositoriesBetweenSessions** that allows
git repositories information to be stored between sessions, avoiding the waiting time in the first
time you load the repositories list. It's **false** by default.

    {
        "gitProjectManager.storeRepositoriesBetweenSessions": true
    }

To improve performance there are 2 new and important configurations that are:
**ignoredFolders**: an array of folder names that will be ignored (*node_modules for example*)

    {
        "gitProjectManager.ignoredFolders": ["node_modules"]
    }

**maxDepthRecursion**: indicates the maximum recursion depth that will be searched starting in the configured folder (default: `2`)

    {
        "gitProjectManager.maxDepthRecursion": 4
    }


In version 0.1.10 we also added the **"gitProjectManager.checkRemoteOrigin"**
configuration that allows users to not check remote repository origin
to improve performance

    {
        "gitProjectManager.checkRemoteOrigin": false
    }

Added in version 0.1.12, you can configure the behavior when opening a project if it'll be opened in the same window
or in a new window. (*this option is ignored if there aren't any opened folders in current window*)):

    {
        "gitProjectManager.openInNewWindow": false
    }
