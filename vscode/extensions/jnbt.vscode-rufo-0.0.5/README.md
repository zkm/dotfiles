# vscode-rufo

This Visual Studio Code extension provides formatting via
[Rufo](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo). It will be used
with files that have the “Ruby” syntax. Supports setups via [RVM](http://rvm.io)
or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

## Installation

Press `F1`, type `ext install` then search for `jnbt.vscode-rufo`.

### `rufo` installation

Before using this plugin, you must ensure that `rufo`, version 0.10.0 or
higher, is installed on your system. To install `rufo`, do the following:

1.  Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

2.  Install [Rufo](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo#installation) by typing the
    following in a terminal:

    ```shell
    gem install rufo
    ```

If you're are using [RVM](http://rvm.io) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), seek
for more information below.

## Settings

You can configure vscode-rufo in your workspace or user settings. You can either

a) Open VS Code settings menu, select "Extensions" and scroll down to "Rufo"

b) Manually adjust your settings via your `settings.json` file:

```js
{
  ...
  "rufo.exe": "rufo",  // can be an absolute path
  "rufo.useBundler": false,
}
```

*Attention:* Restart Visual Studio Code after you have made changes to the settings.

### Using RVM

If your setup instruments [RVM](http://rvm.io) to install Ruby version
you might receive errors indicating Rufo can't be found. Because `rufo`
might not be in your current PATH, you need to change the executable
to the RVM-wrapped one:

```js
"rufo.exe": "/Users/You/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.6/wrappers/rufo"
```

### Using `rbenv`

If your setup instruments [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), you should
point the executable to the Rufo shim generated by rbenv. This way the extension
will continue to work after you upgrade your Ruby:


```js
"rufo.exe": "/Users/You/.rbenv/shims/rufo"
```
