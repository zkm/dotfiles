            Reserved to be used by the compiler for tracking metadata.
            This class should not be used by developers in source code.
            This dummy class is required to compile records when targeting .NET Standard

            This class helps de-duplicate dynamically created strings which might otherwise lead to memory bloat.

        <member name="T:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Razor.ProjectEngineHost.Serialization.StringCache.ExfiltratingEqualityComparer">
            <summary>
            This is a gross hack to do a sneaky and get the value inside the HashSet out given the lack of any Get operations in netstandard2.0.
            If we ever upgrade to 2.1 delete this and just use the built in TryGetValue method.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This is fragile on the ordering of the values passed to the EqualityComparer by HashSet.
            If that ever switches we have to react, if it becomes indeterminate we have to abandon this strategy.
