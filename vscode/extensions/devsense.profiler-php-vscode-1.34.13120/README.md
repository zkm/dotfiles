Xdebug profile files (_cachegrind format_) can be opened, viewed, and inspected. The extension also highlights **hot paths** in your code, according to the profiling results. There is more, please see the features below for the details.

## Overview

PHP code profiling allows you to inspect how much time and how many calls were made to every single function in the code.

The extension enables inspecting of Xdebug profile files which contain information about PHP code performance. It works best in combination with [PHP Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode). Debug, profile, and inspect the profiling results right in Visual Studio Code.

### Quickly Setup PHP for Profiling

- Ensure, you have PHP installed.
- Ensure [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/docs/install) PHP extension is installed as well.
- Make sure PHP `zlib` extension is enabled (recommended).
- Check your `php.ini` setting:
    ```ini
    xdebug.output_dir="<an output directory>"
    ```
- With [PHP Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DEVSENSE.phptools-vscode), use the following `launch.json` setting:
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Launch Built-in server & Profile",
        "type": "php",
        "request": "launch",
        "runtimeArgs": [
            "-S", "localhost:8888", "-t", "."
        ],
        "noDebug": true, // <-- disable debugging
        "profile": true, // <-- enable profiling
    }
    ```

## Opening Profiling Result

Open the file containing your profiling data. By default, it is in form of `cachegrind.out.%p.gz`.

**Using Command Palette**

- Bring the **Command Palette**, and run `Open Profile File (Xdebug Profiling Output)`.
- Choose the file, and confirm.

**Drag & Drop "cachegrind.out.*.gz" File**

Alternatively, if your profile file name is in form of `cachegrind.out.%p.gz`, you can open the file right in the Visual Studio Code editor - using `File`/`Open File` menu.

> Be aware, large files may take some time to open.

## Inspecting Call Times

The following view lists all the functions with the number of calls (_Calls_), time spent by the function body (_Self Time_), and time including nested calls (_Time_).

## Inspecting Callers/Callees

The **Function Details** view is focused on a single function; and displays all the calling functions and all the called functions, including the time information.

## Highlighting Hot Paths

The loaded profiling result file is analyzed, and hot paths are highlighted directly in the source code. Highlighting can be turned off in the profiling result view.
